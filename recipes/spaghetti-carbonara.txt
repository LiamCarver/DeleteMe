Spaghetti Carbonara

Summary:
A creamy, savory pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper.

Ingredients:
- 12 oz spaghetti
- 4 oz pancetta, diced
- 2 large eggs
- 1 large egg yolk
- 3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmesan)
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- Salt, for pasta water

Steps:
1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente.
2) While pasta cooks, render pancetta in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove from heat.
3) In a bowl, whisk eggs, egg yolk, cheese, and black pepper until smooth.
4) Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain spaghetti.
5) Add hot spaghetti to the skillet with pancetta. Toss to coat.
6) Off heat, pour in egg mixture, tossing quickly to avoid scrambling. Add splashes of pasta water to make a silky sauce.
7) Season with more pepper and serve immediately.
